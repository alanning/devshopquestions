<h3>Discover Meteor:</h3> This is The Book for learning Meteor (interactive e-book with live app instances, actually). Community-authored by Tom Coleman and Sacha Greif, it's the quickest way to get up to speed, and well worth its price. You can probably find some people at Devshop who have a copy, if you ask around nicely. Assumes some familiarity with JavaScript. (<a href="http://discovermeteor.com">discovermeteor.com</a>)

<h3>Meteor 101:</h3> Core dev Naomi Seyfer led a Meteor 101 workshop with live coding during Devshop 2. You can find it on the official MeteorVideos YouTube channel. (<a href="http://videos.meteor.com">videos.meteor.com</a> → search: Meteor 101)

<h3>Evented Mind:</h3> the home of in-depth Meteor screencasts by Chris Mather. It's one of the best learning resources for intermediate and advanced topics. Great for when you've built an app or two and want to dig into how Meteor works on the inside. (<a href="http://eventedmind.com">eventedmind.com</a>)

<h3>Best Learning Resources for Meteor.js:</h3> this compilation by Stephan Hochhaus lists a huge number of tutorials and other resources you can browse, for Meteorites of all levels.
