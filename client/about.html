    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Questions only, please! If you would like to make an announcement to your fellow Devshop-goers, please tweet the announcement and tag it <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23meteordevshop&f=realtime">#MeteorDevshop</a>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Please mark your question as "answered" if it has been addressed, or delete it if you want to take it back. Questions should be "actionable," i.e. there should be a definable endpoint for when the question has been answered.</p></li>
      <li><p>If your question is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">Stack Overflow-type question</a>, consider posting the question there (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/meteor">tagged meteor</a>), then linking to it in your Devshop Questions post. This allows the rest of the Meteor community to benefit from your question, and people outside of Devshop may be able to help you too. Don't forget to share the answer on SO if you are helped at Devshop. (Read: "<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">How do I ask a good question?</a>") </p></li>
      <li><p>Not all questions need to be Stack Overflow-type questions! Because answerers help you in person, it's fine to ask a question like "Can someone explain (X concept) to me? I keep reading about it, but still don't understand." Or "Can someone come click through my app for 5 minutes? I want to see if the UI is intuitive."</p></li>
      <li><p>You don't need to describe your question in exhaustive detail, but you should provide enough context for someone to predict whether they can help you. Meteorites of all levels attend Devshop and answer questions. "Help with a bug?" is not a good question.</p></li>
      <li><p>If you have feedback about the DevshopQuestions app, please e-mail <a href="mailto:community@meteor.com">community@meteor.com</a>. Enjoy!</p></li>

<h3>How to learn Javascript properly:</h3> If you are new to developing with JavaScript, Richard Bovell has an excellent curriculum you can follow, with tracks for absolute beginners and for people with some programming background.
(Google: How to learn JavaScript properly → first result)

<h3>Discover Meteor:</h3> This is The Book for learning Meteor (interactive e-book with live app instances, actually). Community-authored by Tom Coleman and Sacha Greif, it's the quickest way to get up to speed, and well worth its price. You can probably find some people at Devshop who have a copy, if you ask around nicely. Assumes some familiarity with JavaScript. (<a href="http://discovermeteor.com">discovermeteor.com</a>)

<h3>Meteor 101:</h3> Core dev Naomi Seyfer led a Meteor 101 workshop with live coding during Devshop 2. You can find it on the official MeteorVideos YouTube channel. (<a href="http://videos.meteor.com">videos.meteor.com</a> → search: Meteor 101)

<h3>Evented Mind:</h3> the home of in-depth Meteor screencasts by Chris Mather. It's one of the best learning resources for intermediate and advanced topics. Great for when you've built an app or two and want to dig into how Meteor works on the inside. (<a href="http://eventedmind.com">eventedmind.com</a>)

<h3>Best Learning Resources for Meteor.js:</h3> <a href="http://yauh.de/articles/376/best-learning-resources-for-meteorjs">This compilation by Stephan Hochhaus</a> lists a huge number of tutorials and other resources you can browse, for Meteorites of all levels.

    Stack Overflow is great for specific technical questions and troubleshooting. (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/meteor">stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/meteor</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
    The Meteor-talk google group is a public discussion list for technical questions, job posts, or just to let people know what you're working on. (<a href="groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-talk">link</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
    The #meteor IRC channel on Freenode is full of friendly, helpful people. Check the tips on <a href="https://www.meteor.com/irc">meteor.com/irc</a> first. If you don't have an IRC client, you can use <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net">https://webchat.freenode.net</a>.
